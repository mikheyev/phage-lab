# Phage lab

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/mikheyev/phage-lab)

This is an interactive tutorial teaching the principles of next-generation data analysis using a re-sequencing experiment. It presupposes little programming knolwdge and aims at making the student to think like a bioinformatician.

You can launch it by clicling on the "Launch Binder" badge above. This will launch Binder and build a virutal environment (takes a few minutes), after which you can interactively analyze data. I welcome feedback and suggestions for improvements.

**For advanced users:** You can also build the VM using the `Dockerfile` and run everything locally by pulling the repo into your running image (see [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/docker-data-science/) and [here](http://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/jupyter.html) for tutorials).
